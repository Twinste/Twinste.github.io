                <p>This web site is an online catalog for Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc which is a company that provides
                    x-ray
                    equipment, radiographic, cabinetry, eyewear, gloves, aprons, and other related products.</p>
                <h4>CRAP Principles:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The contrast of the logo is very off both logo designs are very bright and kind of
                        hard to
                        read.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: Font and font color changes dramatically between each section of the webpage not a
                        lot
                        of repetition throughout the webpage.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: Alignment for the page is alright.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Everything is very close together but sectioned reasonably not hard to read but
                        annoying
                        to look at.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>ArtStation is the leading showcase platform for games, film, media & entertainment artists. It
                    enables artists to showcase their portfolios in a slick way, discover & stay inspired, and connect
                    with new opportunities.</p>
                <h4>CRAP Principles:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Because the site mainly uses images for its content contrast isn't too big of an issue however
                        where they do use it it is done very well everything is straightforward to read and
                        eye-catching.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: There is constant repetition used throughout this web page all Fonts colors the
                        shapes are used well.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: All the elements of the page lineup are excellent and are done orderly.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Being a site where their primary content is images I would say that proximity isn't
                        that big of an issue for them the gallery of image sections taking up most of the web page makes
                        it easier for the proximity to look good.</li>
                </ul>
