                            <p>While a garden is a very general term that includes a broad range of plant growing,
                                botanical gardens are a purposeful collection of plants grown for more than just their
                                beauty. Botanical gardens hold curated collections of plants for inventory, education,
                                conservation, and research. The UNC Charlotte Botanical Gardens partakes in all of these
                                aspects of being a botanical garden. We are a member of the American Public Gardens
                                Association (APGA) and are dedicated to sharing the world of plants with people through
